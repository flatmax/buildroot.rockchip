# RK3308, RK3328, RK356X, RK3588 buildroot system

Now builds for rk3308, rk3328, RK3566 and RK3588

This repo generates a bootable sdcard image for the RK3xxx platform.
It is a 64 bit image. Based on buildroot, this directory is an external buildroot tree - it integrates into the main buildroot tree seamlessly.

For the RK3399 buildroot images, have a look at this dedicated repo : https://github.com/flatmax/buildroot.rk3399.external

# Initial setup

Clone buildroot. For example :

```
cd yourPath
git clone git://git.busybox.net/buildroot buildroot

# rock pi S tested with version : git checkout 2022.02.1
# rock pi 3a tested with version : git checkout 2022.08.1
# rock cm3 tested with version : git checkout 2022.08.2
# rock 5b tested with version : git checkout 2022.05
```

Make sure you have requirements :
```
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential gcc g++ autoconf automake libtool bison flex gettext
sudo apt-get install -y patch texinfo wget git gawk curl lzma bc quilt
```

If building in a minimal Docker image, you will also require :
```
sudo apt-get install -y cpio unzip rsync python3
```

If building for the cm3 and rock3 derivatives (and possibly others), you will need a minimal python2 system :
```
sudo apt install python2
```

***The above instructions apply to Debian-based distros.  Buildroot works on other distros, but installing the above dependencies is beyond the scope of this README; check your distro's package manager documentation.  Additionally the dash shell is required on distros where it is not the default.***

Clone the external buildroot tree :
```
git clone https://github.com/flatmax/buildroot.rockchip.git buildroot.rockchip.ext
```

# To make the system

```
# For the RockPi S
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.rockPiS.sh yourPath/buildroot
# for the Radxa rock 3 a board
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.rock3a.sh yourPath/buildroot
# for the Radxa rock 5b board
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.rock5b.sh yourPath/buildroot
# for the Radxa rock cm3 io board
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.cm3.sh yourPath/buildroot
# For the RockPi E (rk3328 based board) [needs more work]
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.rockPiE.sh yourPath/buildroot
# For the Pine64 Quartz64 (rk3566 based board) [currently not working]
source buildroot.rockchip.ext/setup.quartz64.sh yourPath/buildroot
```

Make sure you have the buildroot downloads directory present (when you are in the yourPath/buildroot directory execute the following) :

```
mkdir ../buildroot.dl
```

# build the system

```
make
```

# installing

Insert your sdcard into your drive and make sure it isn't mounted. Write the image to the disk.

NOTE: The following command will overwrite any disk attached to $OF. Don't overwrite your root.

```
OF=/dev/sdf; rootDrive=`mount | grep " / " | grep $OF`; if [ -z $rootDrive ]; then sudo umount $OF[123456789]; sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=$OF; else echo you are trying to overwrite your root drive; fi
```

# using

Connect to the console debug uart with a serial cable. Or, add the openssh-server pacakge to the buildsystem, then ssh in as user root, no pass.

## ssh RSA keys

To use ssh, put your id_rsa.pub into the authorized_keys in the overlays directory. This will autoload your public RSA key to the embedded system so that you can login.
```
$ mkdir -p overlays/root/.ssh; chmod go-rwx overlays/root/.ssh
$ ls -ld overlays/root/.ssh
drwx------ 2 me me 4096 Aug  3  2016 overlays/root/.ssh
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub > overlays/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ ls -l overlays/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
-rw-r--r-- 1 me me 748 Feb 24 11:17 overlays/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

# TODO
## for the rk3308 board
Try to find suitable rock-chip boot binaries on github. rk3308_ddr_589MHz_uart0_m0_v1.26.bin can't be found in rkbin.
Shift uboot and the kernel to mainline Linux.
