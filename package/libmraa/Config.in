	  mraa is a C/C++ library with bindings to javascript & python
	  to interface with the IO on Galileo, Edison & other
	  platforms, with a structured and sane API where port
	  names/numbering matches the board that you are on.

    This package downloads a fork from Radxa development of the mraa 
    library which adds support for pull-up resistors for Rock 3A.
